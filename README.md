# NBA2K20DataCleaner
Simple data cleaning using python pandas, and data visualization using matplotlib.pyplot!
I pulled some public data from Kaggle on a game I loved to play, and started practicing some key Python libraries for Data Analytics. In this file, is data that I've cleaned (removed null rows, removed duplicates) and have organized into a bar chart that represents the highest overall players in the game based on their overall levels as the Y axis, and their names as the X axis.
In this file, I use the Pandas, and Matplotlib.pyplot libraries, (as well as tampered with seaborn) to develop more skills for Data Science. If you have any tips, or recommendations, please reach out! I'm enthusiastic about learning Data Science.
